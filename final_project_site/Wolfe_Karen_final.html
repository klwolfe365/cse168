		<h3>Proposal</h3>
		<p>For this project I wanted to implement the following non-photorealistic rendering 
		algorithms: Cel Shading with feature edges, pencil shading, and cool-to-warm shading. 
		All of these algorithms were integrated into the miro base code and are implemented 
		using ray tracing over GLSL shaders, and to do so I followed the techniques laid out 
		in the following paper, <a href="http://www.markmark.net/npar/npar2000_lake_et_al.pdf">
		Stylized Rendering Techniques For Scalable Real-Time 3D Animation </a>. 
		For my final image, I combined Cel Shading with pencil shading to produce an image 
		that appeared to be&nbsp; a "work in progress." 
		The background of the image was intended to look like it was still being drawn out 
		where as objects in the foreground were already colored in.</p>

		<h3>Cel Shading</h3>
		<p>The goal of the cel shader is to mimic cartoon images where there is no smoothly 
		shaded lighting. Rather lighting is split into distinct bands of the color intensity. 
		The shader allows the user to pass in a base color along with color ranges (0-1) for 
		the 1D texture mapping of color, with the dark banding being on the low end of the 
		range and the light banding being near the top of the range. Based off the surface 
		normal dotted with the direction to the light, surfaces that face more away from the 
		light are thus colored in the darker intensity of the base color and surfaces that 
		are more directly illuminated use the lighter intensities.</p>

		<h3>Feature Edges</h3>
		<p>To implement feature edges, I followed the following paper, 
		<a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/~roni/research/projects/NPR-lines/NPR-lines.NPAR09.pdf">
		Ray Tracing NPR-Style Feature Lines</a>. Knowing whether or not a ray strikes the 
		scene near a feature line requires knowing what happens with the rays that strike 
		around the ray of interest. I followed the section about tracing ray stencils to 
		find these surrounding hit points to draw feature lines. If this ray stencil hits 
		different objects, then the current ray is near an edge or an intersection, so an 
		edge is drawn. If the ray stencil is contained within the same object, then it's a 
		crease edge or self-occluding silhouette. A crease is determined by looking at the 
		surrounding normals of the hit location, and if the dot product is within some 
		threshold, we draw the crease. A silhouette is determined if the distance of the 
		other hits in the scene is above some threshold.</p>
		<p>Line weights are determined using the edge-weight metric given in the paper, 
		where the thickness of the edge is used a weight against the sample color.</p>

		<h3>Pencil Shading</h3>
		<p>Different pencil stroke textures and a single paper texture are loaded into the 
		shader. To do so, I had to write a method to read in .ppm files and that data is 
		stored into an unsigned char array. With the current setup of the shader, textures 
		should be read in order from lightest (aka the paper texture) to darkest (near 
		solid black hatching). Now that textures are ordered in density of pencil strokes, 
		this can be used when shading the image. We take the normal of the hit location and 
		dot that with the direction to the light and index into the texture array to find 
		the darkest texture to use. All textures from the base paper texture to the indexed 
		texture are then layered to shade the given point. As for indexing into the texture, 
		UV coordinates are fixed to the pixel coordinates for that given hit location, giving 
		the image a flat appearance. Future improvements for the pencil shader could be to 
		associate UV coordinates with the actual triangle mesh to have the pencil strokes 
		follow curvatures in the object.</p>

		<h3>Cool-to-Warm Shading</h3>
		<p>Although this was not used in the final rendering of the image, this type of 
		shading is often low intensity and is used to given impressions of an object's 
		curvature through color. Surfaces facing in one direction are shaded with one 
		color and those facing the light are given a warm color. The final color is just a 
		linear blend of cool and warm colors modulated by a&nbsp; warmth constant. Although 
		not pictured here, this can be combined with feature edges to further accentuate 
		the shape of the model.</p>
